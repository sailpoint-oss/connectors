# SailPoint Custom Connectors

This repository is a collection of custom connectors implemented for various use cases.  These connectors are implemented in Java and meant to be deployed and run on a virtual appliance (VA).  Each folder in this repository is a self-contained connector that includes all of the code, assets, and documentation needed to deploy, configure, and run the connector on a VA.
