# High-level Guidelines

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and
accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub Flow

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase, and
[Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is our preferred method of accepting pull requests.
The basics of GitHub flow are as follows:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Issue your pull request!

## We Use the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project.

# Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs publicly.  If you see an issue with the site, please [report it here](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/connectors/issues);

Our maintainers _love_ thorough bug reports. **Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or description
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happens
- What actually happens
- Screenshots!
- Operating System
- Browser
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

# Making Feature Requests

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/connectors/issues) to track feature requests.

**Great feature requests** tend to:

- Say if this is related to a problem (and describe said problem)
- Describe the solution you'd like
- Describe alternatives you use or have considered
- Notes (possibly including how you think this might benefit others)

# Submitting a Fix

Looking to fix something yourself? Great! Here are the steps to contribute a fix:

- Fork the repository, copy the main branch only
- Pull down the code, build, and ensure it's running properly
- Create a new branch from main with the naming convention `fix/your-fix-name`
- Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's main branch!

# Submitting a New Feature

Looking to add a new feature yourself? Great! Here are the steps to contribute a feature:

- Fork the repository, copy the main branch only
- Pull down the code, build, and ensure it's running properly
- Create a new branch from main with the naming convention
  `feature/your-feature-name`
- Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's main branch!

# Discussing General Issues or Questions

If none of the above options work for you, you can submit a general issue using GitHub's
[issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/connectors/issues). You
can also head over to the
